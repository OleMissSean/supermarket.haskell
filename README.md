Assignment #2: Supermarket Billing
Revised Deadline: Wednesday, 1 October 2014, 11:59 p.m.

    The Haskell functions yout develop for this assignment should be in a module named Supermarket in a file named Supermarket.hs.

    This assignment requires you to complete several functions from the Supermarket Billing extended exercise from section 6.7 (pages 147-151) of Simon Thompson's Haskell: The Craft of Functional Programming, Third Edition, Addison Wesley, 2011. The instructor will provide you more information on this assignment description. You may download the Haskell file supermarket_base.hs to begin your work.

    All functions in this extended exercise can be implemented using list programming functions from the Prelude and list comprehensions--without directly writing recursive programs. You may use where or let expressions and may define helper functions if needed.

    All students: Implement exercises 6.39 through 6.47.

    CSci 503 students (and optionally CSCI 450 students): Also implement at least one of exercises 6.48 through 6.50.

    Please format and document your program source code appropriately.

    Test your programs appropriately and thoroughly.

    When this assignment is complete, submit your program source code file to Blackboard. Be sure that you identify yourself and the assignments in comments in the source file.

    Also submit a paper copy of the above files at the following class meeting.
